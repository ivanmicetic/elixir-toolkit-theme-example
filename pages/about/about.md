## About the Fellowship
The ELIXIR-UK Fellowship aims to embed Research Data Management (RDM) know-how into UK universities and institutes.
Fellows create training materials, contribute to ELIXIR resources and deliver training locally. We look to support Fellowsâ€™ activities and efforts to build a community of practice within their host institutions.

## The 6 main goals

### 1. Creating bites of content
Fellows produce around 5-10 short videos (3-5 minutes each) on aspects of RDM within their fields of expertise.  These videos focus on relaying basic concepts or signposting larger pieces of work for a research audience.

### 2. Developing training courses
Developing content for face-to-face and online courses.  Working solo or in collaboration with other Fellows,  trainers and ELIXIR members.

### 3. Delivering training locally.
Organising training within their institutions or communities using material developed in the Fellowship or within ELIXIR.

### 4. Seeding local communities of practice
Delivering training courses locally and disseminating training materials helps get interested parties together. The activities of the Fellowship aim to help build the grassroots of a local community of practice.

### 5. Enhancing training skills and competencies
Fellows benefit from ELIXIR training courses, including Train-the-Trainer, and develop coaching relationships with other Fellows and trainers.

### 6. Contributing to international projects
Fellows contribute to RDM best practice and know-how in international resources: FAIR Cookbook, RDMkit
